NOTES:
    Armaan:
    1. Add the feature in the (customer) account page where user can add their default car and home address. With the default car, if the customer adds, system will create a row in the customer_car table and with that car ID, system will add the car to customer's table. If customer doesn't add default, when ever the customer books a ride, the new car will be added to the customer_car table (TEMPORARILY) and then to customer table to link both, but after ride both rows will be deleted.

    2. Ride form should handle the inputs of customer car and car type (automatic and manual).
